    <h2 >Our Mission</h2>
    <p class="article-content">
      Our aim is to reduce carbon emissions with the goal of a net 0 carbon emission across our supply chain. Using this calculator, we can calculate the emissions from our supply chain so we can offset them by planting trees. However, we know that fighting climate change canâ€™t be done alone so we are offering our tools to everyone to help in the fight against climate change.
